  <h1>Hello there!</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Arsen, and I’m a 13-year-old who’s totally into coding and creating amazing stuff. 
    I’ve been passionate about programming for quite a while now, and I’m constantly learning new things 
    to improve my skills. One of my favorite tools is Visual Studio Code because it’s super flexible and 
    perfect for making cool websites. I also use Live Server to test my web projects instantly, which is super convenient when working on adaptive designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Speaking of websites, I absolutely love designing pages that are stylish, modern, and optimized for mobile devices. 
    I think it’s important to create something that not only works well but also looks amazing. That’s why I spend a lot of 
    time on CSS and animations to ensure everything is smooth and visually appealing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Aside from web development, I’m also into hardware projects. I’ve worked with Arduino Uno R3, ESP8266, 
    and even a 0.96 OLED display. I enjoy combining hardware and software to create interesting projects like games, 
    Wi-Fi tools, or even a custom watch. I recently made a Wi-Fi jammer using ESP8266, which was a fun experiment in understanding how networks work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I’m exploring is Python and computer vision. I’ve been using my laptop camera to build projects like motion detectors 
    or AI-powered tools. It’s amazing how technology can do so much with just a little creativity and coding knowledge.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love working on ambitious ideas, like creating my own operating system based on Linux or developing a chatbot with AI that 
    can join groups and answer questions. These big projects push me to think outside the box and learn more advanced skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I write stories and brainstorm unique concepts for games or apps. One idea I’m really excited about is a 2D platformer 
    game where falling means restarting the level—it’s a fun challenge! I also experiment with new programming languages like C and even tools 
    like Processing for creative coding.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all, I’m super excited about the future and all the cool things I can create. Whether it’s a stunning website, a useful app, or 
    an innovative hardware project, I’m always ready to take on a new challenge!
  </p>
